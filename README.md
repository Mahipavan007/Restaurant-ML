Abstract— In today's digital age, online restaurant reviews and ratings have become pivotal in influencing consumer decisions and shaping the reputation of food service businesses. With the exponential rise of food delivery platforms and restaurant discovery services such as Zomato and Swiggy, vast amounts of data are generated daily by users in the form of reviews, ratings, and other restaurant-related metadata. Accurately predicting a restaurant’s rating based on such structured and unstructured features can offer substantial benefits to both customers and restaurateurs.
This project explores the application of machine learning techniques to predict restaurant ratings using a dataset comprising attributes like location, average cost, type of cuisine, number of votes, price range, delivery options, and more. The goal is to build an intelligent system that can effectively learn patterns from historical data and forecast ratings with high accuracy. Various preprocessing steps were undertaken, including handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and selecting important features to enhance model performance.
Multiple regression algorithms were experimented with, including Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor, and Gradient Boosting Regressor. Among them, ensemble learning models demonstrated superior predictive capabilities, with Random Forest achieving the best performance in terms of accuracy and generalization. Evaluation metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R-squared Score (R²) were used to assess the model's effectiveness.
The results of the project indicate that machine learning can serve as a powerful tool in predicting restaurant ratings and can be integrated into recommendation engines or review platforms to guide user choices and support restaurant management in strategic planning. Future work can include integrating natural language processing (NLP) for textual review analysis and deploying the model through an interactive user interface for real-time prediction and insights.
