# Restaurant-ML
Abstract— In today's digital age, online restaurant reviews and ratings have become pivotal in influencing consumer decisions and shaping the reputation of food service businesses. With the exponential rise of food delivery platforms and restaurant discovery services such as Zomato and Swiggy, vast amounts of data are generated daily by users in the form of reviews, ratings, and other restaurant-related metadata. Accurately predicting a restaurant’s rating based on such structured and unstructured features can offer substantial benefits to both customers and restaurateurs.
This project explores the application of machine learning techniques to predict restaurant ratings using a dataset comprising attributes like location, average cost, type of cuisine, number of votes, price range, delivery options, and more. The goal is to build an intelligent system that can effectively learn patterns from historical data and forecast ratings with high accuracy. Various preprocessing steps were undertaken, including handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and selecting important features to enhance model performance.
Multiple regression algorithms were experimented with, including Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor, and Gradient Boosting Regressor. Among them, ensemble learning models demonstrated superior predictive capabilities, with Random Forest achieving the best performance in terms of accuracy and generalization. Evaluation metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R-squared Score (R²) were used to assess the model's effectiveness.
The results of the project indicate that machine learning can serve as a powerful tool in predicting restaurant ratings and can be integrated into recommendation engines or review platforms to guide user choices and support restaurant management in strategic planning. Future work can include integrating natural language processing (NLP) for textual review analysis and deploying the model through an interactive user interface for real-time prediction and insights.
I. INTRODUCTION
The online food and restaurant discovery industry has experienced exponential growth in recent years, driven by increased internet penetration, smartphone usage, and the convenience of food delivery applications. Platforms such as Zomato, Swiggy, Uber Eats, and Yelp have become popular hubs where users not only explore dining options but also contribute millions of reviews and ratings based on their dining experiences. These platforms generate vast amounts of structured and unstructured data, offering valuable insights into customer preferences and restaurant performance.
As user-generated content continues to grow, the ability to analyze and derive meaningful patterns from such data has become increasingly important. Accurate prediction of restaurant ratings using machine learning can serve multiple purposes: it can simplify the decision-making process for customers by highlighting quality restaurants; it can also provide actionable insights for restaurant owners and managers to improve their offerings, pricing, and customer engagement strategies.
The core objective of this project is to design and implement a machine learning model that can predict the rating of a restaurant based on a set of measurable attributes such as location, cuisine type, average cost for two, availability of table booking or delivery options, number of votes, and other categorical or numerical features. The dataset undergoes preprocessing, including handling missing values, feature encoding, and normalization, to ensure model readiness. The final predictive system aims to achieve high accuracy, scalability, and interpretability, ultimately contributing to both enhanced customer satisfaction and better business outcomes for restaurants.
